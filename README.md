# RoverTest
Arduino application to test the basic interfaces for the 3-wheel Rover robot with 2 stepper-motor driven wheels, a 180 degree servo motor to swing an ultrasonic sensor to take measurements and an IR sensor for remote inputs (not tested).   

The LAFVIN Arduino UNO R3 on the Rover robot may require a USB driver install on your PC to upload your program in the Arduino IDE to your robot.  Follow the directions at (https://lafvintech.com/blogs/new/how-to-install-ch340-driver-on-windows) to download and install the USB drivers if your IDE returns an error when uploading your program.
